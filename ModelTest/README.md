# ModelTest

#### A sandbox where I tested several object detecion models and where I test some other parts of the algorithm.

#### [src](/src) contains the Python scripts
#### [data](/data) contains test images
#### [results](/results) contains some results that I obtained
> Note: the data results folder are usually not the latest, since I do most of the testing on the Jetson directly
